Settings Improvement
====================

This module improves some native administrations features.

Only improvements based on "base" can be included in this module.

Note: the flag "auto_install" is set to True hereafter, thus the module will be automatically installed each time a new DB will be created. To avoid
this principle, reset simply this flag to False.
