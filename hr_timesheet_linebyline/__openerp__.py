!!! THIS MODULE IS NOT YET MIGRATED !!!

HR Timesheet Line-by-Line
=========================

This module provides a simplified timesheet view for service companies.

It has the following features:
 * the attendence-related fields are hidden in the timesheet form
 * all lines of a week can be entered in a single list
   (instead of the default day by day view)
 * inherited from the c2c hr_timesheet_task module, it adds the task field
   in the timesheet view, allowing to select tasks directly when entering timesheets,
   (instead of the default which requires opening tasks to enter time)
 * the to_invoice field is hidden, and automatically set from the analytic account
   when the timesheet is confirmed (the rationale being that normal users do not
   decide themselves if their hours need to be invoiced or not)
 * when changing the start date of the timesheet, a sensible default is proposed
   for the end date
 * remake visible the user_id field in the timesheet lines table in the task view
